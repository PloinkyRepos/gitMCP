# DS03 - MCP Tool Contracts and Invocation Lifecycle

## Role of This Document

This document defines contract guarantees for MCP tool behavior and invocation lifecycle rules.

## Contract Surface

Tool names declared in `mcp-config.json` are public agent contracts. Contracts cover repository inspection, staging and restore flows, conflict handling, stash and commit flows, remote operations, identity management, and GitHub auth lifecycle operations.

Each contract shall define input schema expectations and tool identity mapping through `TOOL_NAME` semantics and dispatcher resolution.

## Invocation Lifecycle Rules

Lifecycle Rule L1: each invocation begins by reading MCP envelope input from stdin.

Lifecycle Rule L2: payload normalization shall handle expected MCP envelope shapes and extract effective input arguments.

Lifecycle Rule L3: argument normalization shall enforce tool-specific requirements before operation dispatch.

Lifecycle Rule L4: path arguments shall be resolved and validated against allowed roots before Git operation execution.

Lifecycle Rule L5: successful operation results shall be serialized to stdout as contract output.

Lifecycle Rule L6: failures shall return explicit JSON error payloads with `ok: false`.

## Failure Semantics

Failure Rule F1: unsupported tools fail explicitly.

Failure Rule F2: missing required arguments fail explicitly.

Failure Rule F3: Git subprocess failures remain attributable with normalized error messages.

Failure Rule F4: timeout failures remain explicit and cannot degrade into silent partial success.

## Constraints

Constraint M1: contracts cannot depend on undocumented input payload fields.

Constraint M2: tools cannot execute operations outside validated repository paths.

Constraint M3: mixed output formats for the same contract are forbidden unless explicitly declared.

## Invariants

Invariant T1: tool contract identity remains explicit through declared name and dispatch mapping.

Invariant T2: lifecycle stages remain ordered as parse, validate, dispatch, execute, respond.

Invariant T3: remote auth helpers may enrich payloads but do not redefine contract names.

## Validation Criteria

Validation is satisfied when MCP clients can call declared tools with schema-compliant inputs, receive deterministic success or explicit error payloads, and observe consistent lifecycle behavior across invocations.
