# GA01 - Git Agent Overview

## Summary

`gitAgent` is the MCP agent responsible for workspace-scoped Git operations and for the Git user experience exposed through Explorer.

## Background / Problem Statement

Explorer needs Git capabilities without binding the UI directly to shell commands, repository discovery rules, authentication handling, or per-repository operational logic. `gitAgent` provides that boundary.

## Goals

1. Expose Git operations through MCP tools that are safe to call from Explorer.
2. Restrict Git operations to valid workspace repository roots.
3. Centralize Git authentication, repository status inspection, commit/push/pull flows, and conflict support.
4. Keep sensitive credentials out of browser storage.

## Non-Goals

- Acting as a general-purpose Git client for arbitrary paths outside the workspace.
- Moving the Git UI into Explorer core.
- Treating browser storage as a source of truth for access tokens.

## Architecture Overview

| Area | Responsibility |
|---|---|
| `tools/git_tool.sh` + `tools/git_tool.mjs` | MCP tool dispatch and request orchestration |
| `lib/git-service.mjs` | low-level Git execution and repository operations |
| `lib/github-auth.mjs` | GitHub device flow, auth status, metadata persistence |
| `lib/dpu-secret-client.mjs` | per-user secret storage bridge to `dpuAgent` |
| `IDE-plugins/git-tool-button/` | Explorer-facing Git UI plugin |

## Authentication Model

`gitAgent` supports two user-facing authentication modes:

1. GitHub device flow
2. Manual token entry

Both modes persist the effective token in DPU Secrets, not in browser `localStorage`.

### Token persistence rules

- There is a single GitHub token secret per user.
- The secret is stored in DPU using a stable key managed by `gitAgent`.
- Browser storage may keep non-sensitive UI metadata, such as the selected auth method or GitHub profile metadata, but not the token itself.
- Local state in `.ploinky/state/git-agent-github-auth.json` may keep non-sensitive connection metadata and pending device-flow state, but not the token value.

## API Contracts

Primary tools include:

- `git_info`
- `git_status`
- `git_diff`
- `git_commit`
- `git_push`
- `git_pull`
- `git_stash`
- `git_commit_message`
- `git_auth_status`
- `git_auth_begin`
- `git_auth_poll`
- `git_auth_disconnect`
- `git_auth_store_token`

## Behavioral Specification

1. Explorer invokes `gitAgent` MCP tools for repository inspection and operations.
2. `gitAgent` resolves and validates repository paths against the workspace.
3. For authenticated remote operations, `gitAgent` uses:
   - `metadata.authInfo.github.accessToken` when already supplied by the caller, otherwise
   - the per-user token stored in DPU Secrets.
4. GitHub device-flow completion writes the token into DPU and keeps only metadata in local state.
5. Manual token save writes the token into DPU and updates local connection metadata with a non-sensitive source marker.
6. Disconnect removes the per-user token from DPU and clears local metadata.

## Configuration

Relevant variables include:

- `ASSISTOS_FS_ROOT`
- `WORKSPACE_ROOT`
- `PLOINKY_WORKSPACE_ROOT`
- `PLOINKY_GITHUB_CLIENT_ID`
- `PLOINKY_GITHUB_CLIENT_SECRET`
- `PLOINKY_GITHUB_SCOPE`
